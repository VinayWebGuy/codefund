### A crispy story of CodeFund
### `English Version`
#### Vinay’s Role as Admin
Vinay starts his day by logging into CodeFund’s Admin dashboard, where he manages user requests and transactions. Today, Prateek has sent a request via WhatsApp, asking for funds to kick off a new project. Vinay promptly goes to the Deposit Manager, generates a unique ref_id, amount, and secret_code for Prateek’s account, and shares these details securely.

From his dashboard, Vinay can view wallet balances, API requests, and even the payment links generated by users, keeping him in tune with platform activity. This visibility allows him to make adjustments or address permissions when necessary. With everything in order, Vinay logs out, leaving users like Prateek with a secure platform for their transactions.

#### Prateek’s User Journey
Upon receiving Vinay’s secure ref_id, amount, and secret_code, Prateek logs into CodeFund and applies the deposit to his wallet, instantly updating his balance. Now ready for transactions, Prateek heads to the Payment Link section to manage his finances.

Prateek can see all the Payment Links he has generated for clients, along with links that others have generated for him. When it’s time to pay, he can click directly on any payment link to transfer funds in one step. Each payment link also has a QR code, which he can scan or share for instant payment access, making the process simple for both him and his clients.

To keep his workflow smooth, Prateek saves his contacts, adding details like account number, email, and mobile for quick access. In the API Manager, he sets up APIs for different environments like UAT, pre-production, and production, each with its own permissions and access limits. With CodeFund, Prateek can check his balance, view transaction history, and even send funds—all through secure API endpoints.

### `Hinglish Version`
#### Vinay ka Admin Role
Vinay apna din CodeFund ke Admin dashboard pe login karke shuru karta hai, jahan wo user requests aur transactions ka dhyan rakhta hai. Aaj Prateek ne WhatsApp pe ek fund request bheji hai apne naye project ke liye. Vinay turant Deposit Manager mein jaake Prateek ke account ke liye ek unique ref_id, amount, aur secret_code generate karta hai aur ye secure details Prateek ke saath share karta hai.

Vinay apne dashboard se wallet balances, API requests, aur users dwara generate kiye gaye payment links dekh sakta hai, jisse wo platform ki activity mein updated reh sakta hai. Itni visibility ke sath, wo permissions mein adjustments ya zaroori changes kar sakta hai. Sab kuch sahi hai toh Vinay logout kar leta hai, taaki users jaise Prateek ke liye ek secure platform rahe.

#### Prateek ka User Journey
Vinay se ref_id, amount, aur secret_code milte hi, Prateek CodeFund mein login karta hai aur apne wallet mein funds add karta hai, jisse uska balance turant update ho jata hai. Ab wo transactions ke liye tayar hai aur Payment Link section mein apne finances ko manage karta hai.

Prateek apne sabhi Payment Links dekh sakta hai—jo usne clients ke liye banaye hain aur jo doosre users ne uske liye banaye hain. Jab payment karni ho, toh wo kisi bhi payment link pe click karke directly funds transfer kar sakta hai. Har payment link ke sath ek QR code bhi hota hai, jise wo scan ya share karke instant payment access de sakta hai, jo dono taraf ke liye payment ko simple banata hai.

Apne workflow ko smooth banaye rakhne ke liye, Prateek apne contacts save karta hai aur account number, email, aur mobile jaise details add karta hai taaki usse baar-baar yaad na rakhna pade. Phir API Manager mein wo alag-alag environments jaise UAT, pre-production, aur production ke liye APIs set karta hai, har ek mein apne hisaab se permissions aur access limits de sakta hai. CodeFund ke sath, Prateek apna balance check kar sakta hai, transaction history dekh sakta hai, aur funds bhi bhej sakta hai—all secure API endpoints ke sath.

Through CodeFund, Vinay aur Prateek ek easy, secure, aur efficient financial journey experience karte hain, har transaction ko ek dum seamless banate hue!
